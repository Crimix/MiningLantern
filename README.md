# MiningLantern
[Mining Lantern](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mining-lantern) is a small mod that adds only one item to the game.
A mining lantern that can emit light from the player that follows the player.
It does this by using shaders from [Albedo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/albedo), because of its usage of these shaders, the lantern will not emit light (if it does not crash first) if OptiFine is installed because of Albedo's incompatibility with OptiFine.
